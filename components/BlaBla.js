                    <p className="text-sm text-white/80">
                        Rufus is a utility that helps format and create bootable
                        USB flash drives, such as USB keys/pendrives, memory
                        sticks, etc. <br /> <br />
                        It can be especially useful for cases where: <br />{" "}
                        <br />- you need to create USB installation media from
                        bootable ISOs (Windows, Linux, UEFI, etc.) <br />
                        - you need to work on a system that doesn't have an OS
                        installed <br />
                        - you need to flash a BIOS or other firmware from DOS{" "}
                        <br />
                        - you want to run a low-level utility <br />
                        Despite its small size, Rufus provides everything you
                        need! <br /> <br />A non exhaustive list of Rufus
                        supported ISOs is also provided at the bottom of this
                        page.

                        If you create a DOS bootable drive and use a non-US
                        keyboard, Rufus will attempt to select a keyboard layout
                        according to the locale of your system.
